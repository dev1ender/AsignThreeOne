Answer = c

the code will complile fine with both newer and older version of the jdk's but shows error with new version "main method not found...."
But with older version it will run fine and show  the output 10 

The NoSuchMethod error is shown in privous version of the jdk so I can pridict that the Options are with the older version of java
hence the answer is option c which match perfectly with the older version of java
